                                Ithemba Home aims to bridge that gap by providing a haven to the victims as well as help them improve their lives, heal
                                their traumas, and help integrate them back to society to become upstanding citizens. We will build a supportive environment
                                for women and children who have experienced abuse, violence, or in desperate need temporary housing and assistance.

                            <p>
                                We have built a bursary programme, providing opportunities to children to finish their education and woman 
                                who wish to pursue their tertiary education. Our programs have also helped volunteers to be more equipped to handle abuse or situations
                                where there are victims. With the help of our donors, we have been able to provide women and children with
                                proper housing and a safe environment that is healthy for children as well.
